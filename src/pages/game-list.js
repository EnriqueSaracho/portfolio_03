  // This MERN Stack application is a catalog of games that I have played and have yet to play. It allows me to input and display some information about each and rate them based on my subjective opinion. Working on this project has allowed me to learn a few things like importing react components, React Router, Environmental Variables, HTTP Requests, useNavigate(), useState(), React Icons, Database Schemas, and more.

        desc={`This application allows you to save game titles along with useful information such as the series it belongs to, developers, release date, genres, consoles it's available on, and more. On the home page, it sorts them by title, release date, or rating, which you can assign to each game. It's great for creating a list of your favorite games as well as those you wish to play in the future.

        The app is divided into two parts: the client side and the server side. For the client side, I used Create React App to design the frontend. For the server side, I built the backend with Node.js and Express.js, and used a MongoDB Atlas database to store the information.
