# Portfolio Website

I build this porfolio with React. My primary objectives were to make it simple to understand and navigate, and also easy to update. React components, icons, react-router-dom, and JSX flexible code allowed me to achieve that. The home page containes three components/sections, one for my information and links, another one for my skills and finally the projects part. Each project has a page of its own (like this one) with links to the project or code.
